Will Conover and I created an app for the Bowdoin gym. We both don't like to go to the gym when it's crowded, so we created a feature that will tell the user how many people are currently in the gym. Every student has a one card that they need to swipe upon entering the gym, so we used this data to determine the current capacity. We also compiled graphs with daily averages and peak times. 

Our app also provides information on the fitness classes. Users can look at the schedule and add classes to their favorites list. The app will then send a notification when it's class time.
